## Guessing Game Program

This repository contains a simple Java program where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## Description

The program selects a random number within a specified range (1â€“100). The user tries to guess the number, and after each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## How It Works

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user repeatedly inputs guesses.

The program gives feedback after each guess:

Too low if the guess is smaller than the number.

Too high if the guess is larger than the number.

Correct if the guess matches the number.

The program ends when the user guesses the correct number and displays the number of attempts taken.
